# Hello-World
Hi

Hello ! My name is Saif Haq. I'm a  chemist and chemcial enigneer by education. I'm new here and just starting out. I wanted to learn how to code and and develop news skills so that is why i got started. I hope to one day have the skills necessary to change my career and work in AI at some level. I belive i can learn enough on my own and through universities or other means to develops the skills to apply machine learning to various areas such as biotechnology, bussiness, manufacturing and more. Ideally i can build a few good projects to show people what i've learned and the impact i've made so that someone would be willing to take a chance on bringing me in so that i can contribute. Thats is all for now !
